        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a case study that was conducted with Tech Fleet, a non-profit organization giving designers, researchers, and leaders real time experience. The study consisted of around 10 researchers/designers. It was led by Tech Fleet founder Morgan Denner. It went for 5 weeks and meetings were held everyday Mon-Fri. The goal of this study was to gain experience doing Google Sprints, practicing continuous discovery, Lean UX, and working as a role player while designing and researching for a problem and user.</p>

        <p>First we identified a problem that may exist in the world. We conducted secondary research on the subject to learn more about what other related problems existed within our scope.</p>
        <p>We identified and chose a few main components to focus on that we felt were the most important areas to research.</p>

        <h2>Our Topic</h2>
        <h3>Protecting the Vulnerable against Scams</h3>
      </section>

      <section class="cs1-section">
        <h2>Secondary research consisted of these main questions:</h2>
        <ul class="cs1-list">
          <li>What kinds of scams do people experience?</li>
          <li>How do we define “scams”?</li>
          <li>Who are the users most vulnerable to scams?</li>
          <li>What are the most common scams today?</li>
          <li>Do people always know they are getting scammed?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Primary research</strong> was needed to collect information directly from the user answering the most important questions.</p>
        <p>Interview materials were made including a screener, a script, and interview questions.</p>
        <img src="img/script.png" alt="Interview script" class="cs1-image">
        <p>We ran interviews with 8 participants and collected data in tables.</p>

        <p>A survey was also created.</p>

        <p>Much of the survey questions were also open-ended responses that led to various answers.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of every week we synthesized and organized our data from what people said, and also the existing data we found. This was important because it helped us recognize patterns and themes in what we were looking for.</p>
        <img src="img/dumpresult.png" alt="weekly synthesis" class="cs1-image magnify-target">
        <p>We used the scientific method to confirm or deny assumptions, and to build on what we discovered. If we thought something could be valid then tested that with research to prove the validity or significance, from qualitative and qualitative research. These led to new conclusions and new questions to further be studied.

        <p>As we discovered new themes and questions we used prioritization matrices to focus and vote on the most important subjects. Each dot represents a vote.</p>

        <p>A prototype concept was brainstormed to help users deal with social media scams. Then a task flow was created to begin the designing of the app.</p>

        <p>A design was created to help users see through deceiving tactics.</p>
        <p><a href="img/case3/design-mock.jpg">[Add image: design-mock.jpg]</a></p>
        <p>A concept test was performed to test how users responded to the design and concept.</p>
        <p><a href="img/case3/concept-test.jpg">[Add image: concept-test.jpg]</a></p>
        <p>Even with such a minimal design, users felt that our alerts were helpful.</p>

      <section class="cs1-section">
        <p>By conducting primary and secondary research we were able to discover problems that people face today, and by speaking directly to them, learned what their experience has been with online safety.</p>
        <p>By creating a prototype, and focusing on the problems we discovered, we were able to test a solution, and found promising results. This was the beginning of our Lean UX that could have developed into a full design with more time. This process demonstrated thorough research focused on the user, the problem, and the solution.</p>
        <p>In the United States in 2024, consumers filed about 2.6 million fraud reports with the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Sentinel Network. $12.5 billion total losses were reported, and only 252 individuals were convicted.</p>

      <section class="cs1-section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Researching for online safety and scam prevention required knowledge of the most prone victims, and also an overall scope of online fraud and its impact on current and past populations. It also required an understanding of the methods surrounding online fraud, personal accounts from victims, and an overall opinion of people’s first-hand experiences with it.</p>
        <p>This was done by forming a research plan, creating interview questions and conducting interviews, conducting secondary research on existing data, and forming conclusions on previous assumptions. The results impacted the design positively and gave a direction towards what people want, and what their problems are. A design that helped users recognize scams was well understood in concept testing, and when the study ended, the design was left in its prototyping stage ready for more testing and usability testing.</p>
